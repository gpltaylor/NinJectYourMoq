# NinJectYourMoq
A Test project to demo how NinJect can be used to help Mock out services that are coupled into your system.

Using Dependence Injection can sometime mean more code setup on the caller then the service itself. Using NinJect we can move this setup 
to a seperate configuration script and keep implementing our model easier.

At the same time we can implement Mock's for our service models, for example Entity Framework,email Senders etc.
